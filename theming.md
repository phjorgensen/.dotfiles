# Things to theme

Using [tinted-theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming) now, which seems really good!

- [x] Ghostty
- [x] Neovim, through the `tinted-nvim` plugin.
- [x] TMUX
- [x] Waybar
- [x] Rofi
- [x] FZF
- [ ] Yazi, since the theme is a directory, I can't seem to make it work.
- [x] LazyGit, follows the terminal theme.
- [ ] Starship
